    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: One of the configured repositories failed (Unknown),
    xenserver-iso: and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only
    xenserver-iso: safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this:
    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: 1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.
    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: 2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working
    xenserver-iso: upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer
    xenserver-iso: distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the
    xenserver-iso: packages for the previous distribution release still work).
    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: 3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled
    xenserver-iso: yum --disablerepo=<repoid> ...
    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: 4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won't use it by default. Yum
    xenserver-iso: will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it
    xenserver-iso: again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage:
    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: yum-config-manager --disable <repoid>
    xenserver-iso: or
    xenserver-iso: subscription-manager repos --disable=<repoid>
    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: 5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.
    xenserver-iso: Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,
    xenserver-iso: so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much
    xenserver-iso: slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice
    xenserver-iso: compromise:
    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: yum-config-manager --save --setopt=<repoid>.skip_if_unavailable=true
    xenserver-iso:
    xenserver-iso: Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: base/7/x86_64
